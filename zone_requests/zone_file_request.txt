Hi,

We are a group of 3 MSc computer science students working on a research project as part of our coursework for the course "Advanced Topics in IP Networks" led by Dr. Anat Bremler-Barr at IDC Herzliya.
Our project is looking at the prevalence of out-of-bailiwick untrusted glue records.

We would please like to get a copy of the .TLDGOESHERE zone file to assess for statistical purposes.

Thank you,
Steven Karas
