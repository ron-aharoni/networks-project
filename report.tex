\paragraph{Collaboration Statement}
  % I worked alone and only with course materials.
  We worked alone and referred to sources cited inline and in the references section, and well as the course materials.
  % I collaborated on this assignment with (students), got help from (others), and referred to (citations to sources other than class material).

  % General guidelines (for all HWs in this course):
  % • Each student should submit an individual solution.
  % • Do your best to cope with the problem set by yourself.  It is OK to work in groups and to discuss your solution with other students, but these discussions should be verbal. You are not allowed to copy/dictate/etc.
  % • It is perfectly OK to skip some questions. There is no mandatory submission of all questions or all HWs in this course.
  % • For clarifications or any other help, you are welcome to use the course forum in Piazza
  % • Your work should include a header stating everyone you worked with to solve the homework and every other source you have used.
  % • Submit your work electronically via the course Moodle page. Submit your solution in PDF format. Other formats (DOC, ZIP, etc.) are not be accepted. 
  % • In case you scan a handwritten solution, make sure the pages are properly ordered and oriented, the text is in focus, the contrast between the text and the background is high, and the resolution is such that the page width fits a standard computer screen. The whole solution should be submitted in one pdf file.
  % • Failing to meet any of the submissions requirements may result in point deduction or even your submission not being graded.
